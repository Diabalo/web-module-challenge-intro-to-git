## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
Git is a software program made to set files for codes and we use this in Bloomtech to submit our assignments.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is where we go to our assignment for the day and fork it to make it our own. GitHub is then use to put that assignment into a document, git clone it and from there we put it into code grade and do our assignment
3. Why do we create a branch?
a branch helps us be organized and makes life easier to go back an assigment or submitting a project.
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
to pull the repository
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
Git checkourt
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
git merge is when you combine a branch. git fetch is when you pull data from a repository. git pull does what git fetch does but than merges it into another branch.
7. What is a merge conflict?
this happens when you change something and that change has an impact on another's persons branch.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Do a git pull request and review both affected branches and update them correctly and move foward from there.
